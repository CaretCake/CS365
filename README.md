Scribble Doodle Doo (SDD) is a multiplayer guess-the-word drawing game, complete with idle checking, rounds and full games, scoring, and the ability to submit words to be voted into the actual game.

SDD uses JavaScript, JQuery, Node.JS, and MongoDB. 

### Usage

Shown Below:
1) Log in screen and waiting messages which displays until another player joins.
2) Current drawer (first user) picks a word from three randomly selected options in the database while guessing players are shown a waiting message.
3) Drawing toolbar displays along with the word for the drawer while they draw and the guessers get blank spaces at the top to show the number of letters in the current word.
4) Once all guessers have guessed the word correctly, or the time runs out, the session ends, scores are displayed, and the next player in the round is designated as the drawer. Also shown is the voting screen which displays the list of current submitted words in the database and allows a user to submit additional words and vote on previously submitted words.
